# my-react-boilerplate-with-bootstrap
My PERSONAL React Boilerplate, after studying about **Babel** and **Webpack**:
* it supports **JSX**, **ES6** and **class properties** through **babel** presets and plugins;
* it supports styling with **SCSS** and **Bootstrap**;
* import images with webpack url-loader and file-loader;
* **Client-side routing** with **react-router-dom**.
## TODO
* adjust source-map settings (still not available);
* set up test font from googleFonts.
